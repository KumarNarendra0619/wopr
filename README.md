## Introduction
 _wopr_ is an R package that provides API access to the WorldPop Open Population Repository (wopr.worldpop.org). This gives users the ability to download WorldPop population data sets directly from the R console. It also gives uesrs the ability to spatially query data sets on the WorldPop server to retrieve population estimates with confidence intervals for selected age-sex groups. Spatial queries can be submitted in the form of points or polygons.
